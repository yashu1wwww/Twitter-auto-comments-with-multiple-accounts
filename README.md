# Twiiter-auto-comments-with-multiple-accounts
Twiiter auto comments with multiple accounts using selenium with python

Here, I have added up to 5 accounts which will auto-login and auto-comment to the post. 

# Change the random words if you want different words.

# change the post url in wherever it asked

# replace username with password upto which accounts you need.

# Note: For auto-login, the accounts used must be non-authentication accounts.

# 👉 Note: Every time Twitter updates the code, it varies. So press 'Ctrl+Shift+C' to open the developer tools, and inspect and fork it..

Download the latest version of the Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file. Place it in the folder, open CMD in that particular folder, and enter cmt.py, or double-click on the cmt.py file.

👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then 
the code never run 

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter 

pip install selenium==4.2.1
or
pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter 

and 

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.__version__)"
<to check the current version of selenium>
